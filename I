## Nodle Network

### About Nodle Network

Nodle Network is a decentralized wireless network designed to connect and provide services to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It uses the global network of smartphones as its infrastructure, turning every smartphone into a potential node in the network.

### How It Works

- **Smartphone Infrastructure**: Nodle leverages smartphones as wireless base stations, providing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) coverage for IoT devices. Users can participate by downloading the Nodle app or using integrated partner applications.

- **Proof of Connectivity**: The network uses a "Proof of Connectivity" consensus mechanism. Users are rewarded when their smartphones successfully relay data packets between IoT devices and the internet.

- **NODL Token**: The network uses its native cryptocurrency, NODL, as an incentive mechanism. Users earn NODL tokens for contributing resources like Bluetooth connectivity, bandwidth, and processing power.

### Key Applications

- **Asset Tracking**: Companies use Nodle for asset tracking by connecting BLE-enabled sensors/tags to the network.
- **Authenticating Media Content**: Nodle powers applications for verifying the authenticity of photos and videos by signing content on the blockchain.
- **General IoT Connectivity**: Any BLE-enabled device can leverage the network for data relay and monitoring.

### Technology Highlights

- **BLE & Multi-Protocol Support**: While Bluetooth Low Energy is the main wireless protocol, Nodle can also support Wi-Fi and CBRS.
- **Edge Nodes**: Every participating smartphone acts as an edge node, processing small tasks and relaying packets to the cloud.
- **Decentralization and Privacy**: Nodle's approach is decentralized, cost-effective, and privacy-focused.
